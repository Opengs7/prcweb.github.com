###Building Data Visualisations with D3 One Day Workshop

This one day workshop aims to teach the fundamentals of [D3][d3] and [SVG][svg] so that participants understand concepts such as selection, updating and interaction and are able to put together simple data visualisations built with D3.

The workshop starts with a brief introduction to data visualisation and a discussion of how D3 fits into this landscape.

Following an overview of D3 concepts, the workshop becomes largely interactive with participants working through 3 examples: a bar chart, a circle grid and a scatter plot:

The topics covered during the day include:

- selection
- selection updates e.g. .style(), .classed(), .text()
- joining data
- using function(d, i) for updates
- .enter() & .exit()
- general update pattern
- SVG elements, styling and transforms
- scale functions
- transitions
- loading data
- event handling

The emphasis of the workshop is on gaining a thorough understanding of D3 fundamentals and this is achieved through explanation, demonstration and participants actively coding the examples and further exercises.
