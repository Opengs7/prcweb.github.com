<h3>Energy visualisation</h3>

<p>I've been attending the data visualisation lab days at <a href="http://l4rp.com/">L4RP</a>Â and it's sparked off a revisit to an old project. I logged energy data from an energy monitor for a few months and used the flot library to draw daily graphs of my electricity consumption.</p>

<img title="first_energy_graph" src="/img/6_first_energy_graph.jpg" alt="" />

<p>It was very revealing and helped me reduce my consumption significantly. However, I was aware that the graphs require a fair degree of analysis and interpretation and require an experienced eye to read them. So probably not that revealing to most people.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time trying to develop an algorithm to identify patterns in the data so that information such as: 'your kettle is costing you x pence a week' but to no avail.</p>

<p>However, after attending a lab session at L4RP and finding out about the D3.js library there, I had another think about how the energy data can be presented. The result is a circular (or doughnut?) graph showing a week's usage.</p>

<p>Each of the seven circles represents a day and each day is subdivided into 24 hours. Each segment represents an hour and its colour intensity is proportional to the amount of electricity used in that hour.</p>

<p>The user can instantly see when a significant amount of energy has been used. In the view above, for example, you can see a storage heater turning on at midnight. Such 'invisible' use of energy whilst most people are asleep would usually be hard to track down.</p>
