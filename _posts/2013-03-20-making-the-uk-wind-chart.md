###Making the animated UK wind chart

Blurring the distinction between art, science and the everyday (who isn't interested in the weather?) the animated wind map by Fernanda Vi√©gas and Martin Wattenberg at [hint.fm][hintfm] is an incredible piece of work. Wind is conveyed by animated curves, resulting in a visualisation that is both informative and hypnotic. The historic snapshots of [Hurricane Sandy][Sandy] are particularly poignant.

Peeking under the hood I could see some expert coding and it got me thinking how a similar visualisation could be created using D3.js. This is my first attempt and although it looks pretty good (see it [here][chart]) it has a way to go before it comes close to Fernanda and Martin's.

At the very least it serves as a good demonstration of animated elements in D3.js. Here are some of the more interesting aspects that I'd like to mention:

####The map
A big thank you to Mike Bostock for his brilliantly clear D3 [map tutorial][maptutorial]. Conveniently for us, he generates a map of the UK!

####The animation
By peering very closely at Fernanda and Martin's visualisation I could see that there's two effects in play: animation of curve length and fade in/out.

I experimented creating this effect with D3 by setting up two transitions on each line: the first extends and fades the line in and the second fades the line out. (Note I'm just using straight lines here!)

<div id="svg-container"><svg></svg></div>
<script src="/js/d3.v3.min.js"></script>
<script src="/js/ukwind/lines.js"></script>

{% highlight javascript %}
function lineAnimate(selection) {
    selection
	.attr({x1: 200, x2: 200})
	.attr('y1', function(d) {return d;})
	.attr('y2', function(d) {return d;})
	.style('opacity', 0.5)
	.transition()
		.ease('linear')
		.duration(1000)
	    .delay(function(d) {return d*10;})
		.attr('x2', 500)
	.transition()
		.duration(1000)
		.style('opacity', 0)
	.each('end', function() {d3.select(this).call(lineAnimate)});
}

d3.select('svg')
	.selectAll('line')
	.data([0, 5, 10, 15, 20])
	.enter()
	.append('line')
	.call(lineAnimate);
{% endhighlight %}


####The data
Fernanda and Martin take their data from the [National Weather Service][NWS] which provides the data as a large grid. I haven't looked for similar grid-based data for the UK, rather I've used the Met Office's DataPoint service which provides a [forecast][datapoint] for over 5000 sites in the UK. This data is not arranged as a grid which makes creating nice flowing curves more difficult, as interpolating between grid points is more challenging.

Another issue with the data is that it bunches in particular areas:

![Original data points with bunching](/img/ukwind/original-data-points.jpg)

In hindsight I should've written (or found) a script that could progressively remove points that are close to others. What I actually did was modify the charting script to output a list of points that I'd clicked on... by hand. I spent about an hour clicking points within the dense areas, my eyes have only just recovered!

![Reduced data points](/img/ukwind/reduced-data-points.jpg)

Another drawback of using this dataset was that the wind direction was quantised into just cardinal 16 directions which gives the wind a less smooth appearance.

####And finally
There's a few other desirable features such as using live data and I'd love to try using gridded data so that I can generate a smoother and more packed animation.

All in all I'm happy with the result, considering that this was an experiment. I think that it immediately conveys the nature of the wind and in a more emotive way than the [usual][metofficechart] method of using an arrow and a number.

See the chart [here][chart].

Finally, thank you to the [Met Office][datapoint] for the data and Mike Bostock for [D3][d3].
