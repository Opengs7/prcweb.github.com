###ChartMe WordPress plugin

This is a WordPress plugin for adding Google Chart Tools charts to a WordPress post or page. Data and options are added to WordPress's built-in custom fields and the chart is added using a shortcode.

I've added an example installation at [chartme.prcweb.co.uk][chartme] which includes examples and further documentation. Source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/prcweb/wp-chartme).
